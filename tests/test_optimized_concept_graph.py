    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms 
    and statistical models. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers 
    to process complex data patterns. Natural language processing enables computers 
    to understand human language. Computer vision allows machines to interpret 
    visual information from images and videos.
    
    The development of artificial intelligence has been driven by advances in 
    computational power, algorithm design, and data availability. Modern AI systems
    can perform tasks that were previously thought to require human intelligence,
    such as playing complex games, driving cars, and diagnosing medical conditions.
    
    Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural
    networks. They consist of interconnected nodes that process and transmit information.
    Training these networks involves adjusting the connections between nodes based on
    examples of input-output pairs.
    
    Data science combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract
    insights from data. It involves collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting
    large datasets to make informed decisions. Visualization tools help communicate
    findings to stakeholders and support data-driven decision making.
    
    Computer science is a broad field that encompasses programming, algorithms,
    data structures, software engineering, and systems design. It provides the
    foundation for many modern technologies and applications.
    
    Software engineering involves the systematic approach to designing, developing,
    and maintaining software systems. It includes requirements analysis, system
    design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
    
    Database systems are used to store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of
    information efficiently. They support concurrent access, data integrity,
    and complex queries across multiple tables and relationships.
